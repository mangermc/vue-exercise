# Vue Exercise

When you cloned this repo, you will need to do a few things. You will want to open your Terminal app on your computer and `cd` (change directory) to where you cloned this repo and saved the project.

1. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies for this project.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:<port number>/` to see the app running.

## Requirements
You will need to have `node` and `npm` installed on your computer before you can run this application. You can download [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) through their website.

You can check to see if you have these installed by running the following commands. If you see a version number, that means you have it already installed.

```bash
$ node -v
$ npm -v
```
